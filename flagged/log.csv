            <p>This 600X450 resolution image features multiple objects. One of these objects is a man who is wearing a black shirt and tie, and he is positioned in a way that makes it seem like he is looking at the moon. Another man, this one wearing a suit and tie, is also present in the image, and he too appears to be gazing up at the moon. Additionally, there is a black bear that can be seen in profile, standing out against a dark background. Another man, this one sporting a white beard and black shirt, is also present in the image. Finally, a white sheet of paper with a visible shadow is also part of the picture. While the object positions are varied, each object is clearly visible and can be easily distinguished by its color and shape.</p>
